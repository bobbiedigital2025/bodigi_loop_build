You are an advanced AI developer assistant using MCP Auth and Supabase for storage. Modify my existing BoDiGi Engagement Loop Builder app to include a required 3-tier subscription system. 

‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Do NOT change or remove any of the existing features, build logic, Learn & Earn loops, or bonus prize system already included in the app. Only add this new subscription functionality.

‚úÖ Add the following mandatory subscription system:

1. **Free Trial (7 Days)**:
   - Requires user to input credit/debit card on signup.
   - Full access to Basic Plan features during trial.
   - Auto-charges $9.99 on Day 7 unless canceled.
   - Trial can only be used once per account.

2. **Basic Plan ‚Äì $9.99/month**:
   - 4 builds/month (MVP, branding, marketing loops).
   - Access to Learn & Earn rewards.
   - 2 bonus prize unlocks per month.

3. **Pro Plan ‚Äì $29.99/month**:
   - 20 builds/month.
   - Priority support.
   - 5 bonus prize unlocks/month.

4. **Enterprise Plan ‚Äì $99.99/month**:
   - Unlimited builds.
   - 10 bonus prize unlocks/month.
   - Access to all advanced AI features.
   - Dedicated success support.

üí≥ Subscription is required before users can access the builder.
‚Üí Users must choose a plan on signup.
‚Üí If on Free Trial, card is required at start and stored securely.
‚Üí Access to build tools must be locked unless an active plan is selected.
‚Üí Track build count by plan in Supabase.
‚Üí Reset builds monthly based on plan.

üõ†Ô∏è Additional Requirements:
- Show current build usage count on user dashboard.
- Prevent new builds if user hits limit.
- Optionally prompt to upgrade if build cap is reached.
- Store subscription metadata in Supabase under `subscriptions` table.
- Include logic file: `subscriptionLogic.js`
- Include JSON config: `pricing.json`
- Auto-renew monthly unless canceled via app dashboard.

üìÇ Update the following:
- `README.md` with new pricing and logic
- `PDR` to reflect subscription flow
- `schema.sql` for Supabase updates
- Add subscription choice screen at app start
